    Let $S_k$ be the space obtained by removing $k$ disjoint open disks from the sphere $S^2$. 
    Form $X_k$ by gluing $k$ Möbius bands onto $S_k$ , one for each circle boundary component of $S_k$ (by identifying the boundary circle of a Möbius band homeomorphically with a given boundary component circle). 

    Use van Kampen's theorem to calculate $\pi_1 (X_k)$ for each $k > 0$ and identify $X_k$ in terms of the classification of surfaces.

  question: |
    Suppose the space $X$ is obtained by attaching a 2-cell to the torus $S^1 \times S^1$.

    In other words, $X$ is the quotient space of the disjoint union of the closed disc $\DD^2$ and the torus $S^1 \times S^1$ by the identification $x \sim f(x)$ where $S^1$ is the boundary of the unit disc and $f : S^1 \to S^1 \times S^1$ is a continuous map.

    What are the possible homology groups of $X$? 
    Justify your answer.
