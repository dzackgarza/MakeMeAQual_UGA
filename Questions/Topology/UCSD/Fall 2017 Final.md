Let $X$ be the subspace of the unit cube $I^3$ consisting of the union of the 6 faces and the 4 internal diagonals. Compute $\pi_1(X)$.

# 2

Let $X$ be an arbitrary topological space, and compute $\pi_1(\Sigma X)$.

# 3

Let $X = S^1 \cross S^1$ and $A\subset X$ be a subspace with $A \cong S^1 \vee S^1$. Show that there is no retraction from $X$ to $A$.

# 4

Show that for every map $f: S^2 \to S^1$, there is a point $x\in S^2$ such that $f(x) = f(-x)$.

# 5

How many path-connected 2-fold covering spaces does $S^1 \vee \RP 2$ have? What are the total spaces?


# 6

Let $G = <a, b>$ and $H \leq G$ where $H = <aba^{-1}b^{-1},~ a^2ba^{-2}b^{-1},~ a^{-1}bab^{-1},~ aba^{-2}b^{-1}a>$. To what well-known group is $H$ isomorphic?
