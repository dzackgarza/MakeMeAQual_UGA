  question: |
    Suppose that $f$ is an analytic function in the region $D$ which
    contains the point $a$. Let
    $$F(z)= z-a-qf(z),\quad \text{where}~ q \ \text{is a complex
    parameter}.$$ 

    (1) Let $K\subset D$ be a circle with the center at
    point $a$ and also we assume that $f(z)\not =0$ for $z\in K$. Prove
    that the function $F$ has one and only one zero $z=w$ on the closed
    disc $\bar{K}$ whose boundary is the circle $K$ if $\displaystyle{
    |q|<\min_{z\in K} \frac{|z-a|}{|f(z)|}.}$\
    
    (2) Let $G(z)$ be an analytic function on the disk $\bar{K}$. Apply
    the residue theorem to prove that
    $\displaystyle{ \frac{G(w)}{F'(w)}=\frac{1}{2\pi
    i}\int_K \frac{G(z)}{F(z)} dz,}$ where $w$ is the zero from (1).\
    
    (3) If $z\in K$, prove that the function
    $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{F(z)}}$ can be represented as a convergent
    series with respect to $q$: $\displaystyle{
    \frac{1}{F(z)}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(qf(z))^n}{(z-a)^{n+1}}.}$

    ${\mathbb C} \backslash \{ z_0 \}$, where $z_0$ is a fixed point.
    Assume that $f(z)$ is bijective from
    ${\mathbb C} \backslash \{ z_0 \}$ onto its image, and that $f(z)$
    is bounded outside $D_r(z_0)$, where $r$ is some fixed positive
    number. Show that there exist $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb C$ with
    $ad-bc \neq 0$, $c \neq 0$ such that
