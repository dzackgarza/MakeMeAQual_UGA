    Prove or disprove each of the following statements.

    (a) If $f$ is of bounded variation on $[0,1]$, then it is continuous on $[0,1]$.

    (b) If $f : [0, 1] → [0, 1]$ is a continuous function, then there exists $x_0 ∈ [0, 1]$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.

    (c) Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of uniformly continuous functions on an interval $I$. If $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly to a function $f$ on $I$, then $f$ is also uniformly continuous on $I$.
    
    (h) If $f$ is differentiable on a connected set $E ⊂ \mathbb{R}^n$, then for any $x, y ∈ E$, there exists $z ∈ E$ such that $f(x) − f(y) = ∇f(z)[x − y]$.

    Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
    
    (f) If $E ⊂ \mathbb{R}$ and 

        $μ(E) = \inf\{\sum_{I_i∈S} |I_i| : S = \{I_i\}_{i=1}^n \text{ such that } E ⊂ ∪_{i=1}^n I_i \text{ for some } n ∈ \mathbb{N}\}$

        then $μ$ coincides with the outer measure of $E$.

    (g) If $E$ is a Borel set and $f$ is a measurable function, then $f^{−1}(E)$ is also measurable.

    Let g : $[0, 1] × [0, 1] → [0, 1]$ be a continuous function and let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of functions such that 

    $f_n(x)=\begin{cases}{0,   0\leq x\leq 1/n},\\{\int_0^{x-\frac1n} g(t,f_n(t))dt, 1/n\leq x \leq 1.}\end{cases}$

    With the help of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem or otherwise, show that there exists a continuous function $f : [0, 1] → \mathbb{R}$ such that 

    $f(x) = \int_0^x g(t, f(t))dt$

    for all $x ∈ [0, 1]$. 

    > Hint: first show that $|f_n(x_1) − f_n(x_2)| ≤ |x_1 − x_2|$.
