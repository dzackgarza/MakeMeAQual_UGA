# Midterm

1. Let $G$ be a group of order $p^2q$ for $p, q$ prime. Show that $G$ has a nontrivial normal subgroup.
2. Let $G$ be a finite group and let $P$ be a sylow $p\dash$subgroup for $p$ prime. Show that $N(N(P)) = N(P)$ where $N$ is the normalizer in $G$.
3. Show that there exist no simple groups of order 148.
4. Let $p$ be a prime. Show that $S_p = \gens{\tau, \sigma}$ where $\tau$ is a transposition and $\sigma$ is a $p\dash$cycle.
5. Let $G$ be a nonabelian group of order $p^3$ for $p$ prime. Show that $Z(G) = [G, G]$
6. Compute the Galois group of $f(x) = x^3-3x -3\in \QQ[x]/\QQ$.
7. Show that a field $k$ of characteristic $p\neq 0$ is perfect $\iff$ for every $x\in k$ there exists a $y\in k$ such that $y^p=x$.
8. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p\neq 0$ and $f\in k[x]$ irreducible. Show that $f(x) = g(x^{p^d})$ where $g(x) \in k[x]$ is irreducible and separable. Concluded that every root of $f$ has the same multiplicity $p^d$ in the splitting field of $f$ over $k$.
9. Let $n\geq 3$ and $\zeta_n$ be a primitive $n$th root of unity. Show that $[\QQ(\zeta_n + \zeta_n\inv): \QQ] = \phi(n)/2$ for $\phi$ the totient function.
10. Let $L/K$ be a finite normal extension
  - Show that if $L/K$ is cyclic and $E/K$ is normal with $L/E/K$ then $L/E$ and $E/K$ are cyclic.
  - Show that if $L/K$ is cyclic then there exists exactly one extension $E/K$ of degree $n$ with $L/E/K$ for each divisor $n$ of $[L:K]$.

# Final

1. Let $A$ be an abelian group, and show $A$ is a $\ZZ\dash$module in a unique way.
2. Consider the $\ZZ\dash$submodule $N$ of $\ZZ^3$ spanned by $f_1 = [-1, 0, 1], f_2 = [2,-3,1], f_3 = [0, 3, 1], f_4 = [3,1,5]$. Find a basis for $N$ and describe $\ZZ^3/N$.
