    (a) Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring with 1. Prove $R$ is simple if and only if $R$ is a field.

    (b) Let $k$ be a field. Show the ring $M_n (k)$, $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $k$, is a simple ring.

    For a ring $R$, let $U(R)$ denote the multiplicative group of units in $R$. Recall that in an integral domain $R$, $r \in R$ is called *irreducible* if $r$ is not a unit in R, and the only divisors of $r$ have the form $ru$ with $u$ a unit in $R$. 

    We call a non-zero, non-unit $r \in R$ *prime* in $R$ if $r \divides ab \implies r \divides a$ or $r \divides b$. 
    Consider the ring $R = \{a + b \sqrt{-5}\suchthat a, b \in Z\}$.

    (a) Prove $R$ is an integral domain.

    (b) Show $U(R) = \{\pm1\}$.

    (c) Show $3, 2 + \sqrt{-5}$, and $2 - \sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible in $R$.

    (d) Show 3 is not prime in $R$.

    (e) Conclude $R$ is not a PID.

    Let $F$ be a field and let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over $F$ . 

    Make $V$ and $W$ into $F[x]\dash$modules via linear operators $T$ on $V$ and $S$ on $W$ by defining $X \cdot v = T (v)$ for all $v \in V$ and $X \cdot w = S(w)$ for all w $\in$ W . 

    Denote the resulting $F[x]\dash$modules by $V_T$ and $W_S$ respectively.

    (a) Show that an $F[x]\dash$module homomorphism from $V_T$ to $W_S$ consists of an $F\dash$linear transformation $R : V \to W$ such that $RT = SR$.
