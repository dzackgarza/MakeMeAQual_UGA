  question: |
    For a ring $R$, let $U(R)$ denote the multiplicative group of units in $R$. Recall that in an integral domain $R$, $r \in R$ is called *irreducible* if $r$ is not a unit in R, and the only divisors of $r$ have the form $ru$ with $u$ a unit in $R$. 

    We call a non-zero, non-unit $r \in R$ *prime* in $R$ if $r \divides ab \implies r \divides a$ or $r \divides b$. 
    Consider the ring $R = \{a + b \sqrt{-5}\suchthat a, b \in Z\}$.

    (a) Prove $R$ is an integral domain.

    (b) Show $U(R) = \{\pm1\}$.

    (c) Show $3, 2 + \sqrt{-5}$, and $2 - \sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible in $R$.

    (d) Show 3 is not prime in $R$.

    (e) Conclude $R$ is not a PID.

    - Show that $C_p$ has two irreducible representations over
      $\mathbb Q$ (up to isomorphism), one of dimension 1
      and one of dimension $p-1$.

    - Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\rho:G\rightarrow
      \GL_n(\mathbb Q)$ be a representation of $G$ over $\mathbb Q$.
      Let $\rho_{\mathbb C}:G\rightarrow\GL_n(\mathbb C)$ denote
      $\rho$ followed by the inclusion $\GL_n(\mathbb Q)\rightarrow
      \GL_n(\mathbb C)$. Thus $\rho_{\mathbb C}$ is a representation
      of $G$ over $\mathbb C$, called the \textit{complexification}
      of $\rho$. We say that an irreducible representation $\rho$
      of $G$ is \textit{absolutely irreducible} if its
      complexification remains irreducible over $\mathbb C$.\\
      Now suppose $G$ is abelian and that every representation
      of $G$ over $\mathbb Q$ is absolutely irreducible. Show that
      $G\cong(C_2)^k$ for some $k$ (i.e., is a product of
      cyclic groups of order 2).

    Let $G$ be a finite group and $\mathbb Z[G]$ the internal group algebra.
    Let $\mathcal Z$ be the center of $\mathbb Z[G]$. For each conjugacy class
    $C\subseteq G$, let $P_C=\sum_{g\in C}g$.

    - Show that the elements $P_C$ form a $\mathbb Z$-basis for
      $\mathcal Z$. Hence $\mathcal Z\cong\mathbb Z^d$ as an
      abelian group, where $d$ is the number of
      conjugacy classes in $G$.

    - Show that if a ring $R$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z^d$ as
      an abelian group, then every element in $R$ satisfies
      a monic integral polynomial.
      
      > **Hint:** Let $\{v_1,\dots,v_d\}$ be a basis of
        $R$ and for a fixed non-zero $r\in R$, write $rv_i=\sum_j
        a_{ij}v_j$. Use the Hamilton-Cayley theorem.

    - Let $\pi:G\rightarrow\GL(V)$ be an irreducible representation
      of $G$ (over $\mathbb C$). Show that $\pi(P_C)$ acts on $V$
      as multiplication by the scalar

    Let $K/F$ be a finite Galois extension and let $n=[K:F]$. There is a theorem
    (often referred to as the "normal basis theorem") which states that there
    exists an irreducible polynomial $f(x)\in F[x]$ whose
    roots form a basis for $K$ as a vector space over $F$. You may assume
    that theorem in this problem.

    - Let $G=\Gal(K/F)$. The action of $G$ on $K$ makes $K$ into
      a finite-dimensional representation space for $G$ over $F$.
      Prove that $K$ is isomorphic to the regular representation
      for $G$ over $F$.

      > The regular representation is defined by letting $G$ act
      on the group algebra $F[G]$ by multiplication on
      the left.

    - Suppose that the Galois group $G$ is cyclic and that $F$
      contains a primitive $n^{\text{th}}$ root of unity. Show that
      there exists an injective homomorphism $\chi:G\rightarrow
      F^{\times}$.

      g(a)=\chi(g)\cdot a
      .\end{align*}
      
      for all $g\in G$.

      that $a^n\in F^{\times}$.
