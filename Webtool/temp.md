We call a non-zero, non-unit $r \in R$ *prime* in $R$ if $r \divides ab \implies r \divides a$ or $r \divides b$.

Let $R$ be a PID and $M$ be an $R\dash$module. Let $p$ be a prime element of $R$. The module $M$ is called *$\generators{p}\dash$primary* if for every $m \in M$ there exists $k > 0$ such that $p^k m = 0$.

(a) Suppose M is $\generators{p}\dash$primary. Show that if $m \in M$ and $t \in R, ~t \not\in \generators{p}$, then there exists $a \in R$ such that
$atm = m$.

(b) A submodule $S$ of $M$ is said to be *pure* if $S \cap r M = rS$ for all $r \in R$. Show that if $M$ is $\generators{p}\dash$primary, then $S$ is pure if and only if $S \cap p^k M = p^k S$ for all $k \geq 0$.


\newpage# Question 16 (UW 2014 #7)

Let $C_p$ denote the cyclic group of order $p$.

- Show that $C_p$ has two irreducible representations over
  $\mathbb Q$ (up to isomorphism), one of dimension 1
  and one of dimension $p-1$.

- Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\rho:G\rightarrow
  \GL_n(\mathbb Q)$ be a representation of $G$ over $\mathbb Q$.
  Let $\rho_{\mathbb C}:G\rightarrow\GL_n(\mathbb C)$ denote
  $\rho$ followed by the inclusion $\GL_n(\mathbb Q)\rightarrow
  \GL_n(\mathbb C)$. Thus $\rho_{\mathbb C}$ is a representation
  of $G$ over $\mathbb C$, called the \textit{complexification}
  of $\rho$. We say that an irreducible representation $\rho$
  of $G$ is \textit{absolutely irreducible} if its
  complexification remains irreducible over $\mathbb C$.\\
  Now suppose $G$ is abelian and that every representation
  of $G$ over $\mathbb Q$ is absolutely irreducible. Show that
  $G\cong(C_2)^k$ for some $k$ (i.e., is a product of
  cyclic groups of order 2).

\textit{nilpotent} if $r^n=0$ for some positive integer $n$ and that
the \textit{nilradical} of $R$ is the set $N(R)$ of nilpotent
elements.

- Prove that
  \begin{align*}
  N(R)=\cap_{P\text{ prime}}P.

    wish to construct a prime ideal that does not
    contain $r$ or its powers.

- Given a positive integer $m$, determine the nilradical
  of $\mathbb Z/(m)$.

- Let $L$ be a Galois extension of a field $K$ of degree 4.
  What is the minimum number of subfields there could
  be strictly between $K$ and $L$? What is the maximum
  number of such subfields? Give examples where these
  bounds are attained.
- How do these numbers change if we assume only that $L$
  is separable (but not necessarily Galois) over $K$?
