## Question 1 (UGA 0 #0)

Let $X$ denote the quotient space formed from the sphere $S^2$ by identifying two distinct points. 

Compute the fundamental group and the homology groups of $X$.


\newpage## Question 2 (UGA 0 #0)

Let $L$ be the union of the $z$-axis and the unit circle in the $xy\dash$plane. 
Compute $\pi_1 (\RR^3 \backslash L, \ast)$.


\newpage## Question 3 (UGA 0 #0)

Let $C$ be cylinder. 
Let $I$ and $J$ be disjoint closed intervals contained in $\partial C$. 

What is the Euler characteristic of the surface $S$ obtained by identifying $I$ and $J$? 

Can all surface with nonempty boundary and with this Euler characteristic be obtained from this construction?


\newpage## Question 4 (UGA 0 #0)

Let $X$ be the topological space obtained as the quotient of the sphere $S^2 = \theset{\vector x \in \RR^3 \suchthat \norm{\vector x} = 1}$ under the equivalence relation $\vector x \sim -\vector x$ for $\vector x$ in the equatorial circle, i.e. for $\vector x = (x_1, x_2, 0)$. 

Calculate $H_* (X; \ZZ)$ from a CW complex description of $X$.


\newpage## Question 5 (UGA 0 #0)

Give a self-contained proof that the zeroth homology $H_0 (X)$ is isomorphic to $\ZZ$ for every path-connected space $X$.


\newpage## Question 6 (UGA 0 #0)

Compute the fundamental group, using any technique you like, of $\RP^2 \#\RP^2 \#\RP^2$.


\newpage## Question 7 (UGA 0 #0)

a.  Show that any finite index subgroup of a finitely generated free group is free. 
    State clearly any facts you use about the fundamental groups of graphs.

b.  Prove that if $N$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of infinite index in a finitely generated free group $F$ , then $N$ is not finitely generated.


\newpage## Question 8 (UGA 0 #0)

Let $A$ and $B$ be circles bounding disjoint disks in the plane $z = 0$ in $\RR^3$. 
Let $X$ be the subset of the upper half-space of $\RR^3$ that is the union of the plane $z = 0$ and a (topological) cylinder that intersects the plane in $\partial C = A \cup B$.

Compute $H_* (X)$ using the Mayer--Vietoris sequence.


\newpage## Question 9 (UGA 0 #0)

Does there exist a map of degree 2013 from $S^2 \to S^2$.


\newpage## Question 10 (UGA 0 #0)

Let $M$ and $N$ be finite CW complexes.

a. Describe a cellular structure of $M \times N$ in terms of the cellular structures of $M$ and $N$.

b. Show that the Euler characteristic of $M \times N$ is the product of the Euler characteristics of $M$ and $N$.
